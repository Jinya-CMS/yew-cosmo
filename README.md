# Cosmo Yew by Jinya

## What is Cosmo Yew

Cosmo Yew is a component framework for Yew based on the cosmopolitan design guidelines.

These guidelines were developed by Microsoft as theme for Silverlight. Later they were adapted by the Zune desktop
software and were implemented in the .net
framework ["Modern UI for WPF (MUI)"](https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui).

The Cosmopolitan design was always looking good and quite easy to use.
With Jinya CMS version 18.0.0, the CMS got a new polished administration based on the Cosmo CSS library.

## How to install

You can install Cosmo Yew, by adding the `yew-cosmo` crate to your Cargo.toml
